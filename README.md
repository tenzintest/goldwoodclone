## Reflection

This project was built as a portfolio piece. The intention was to do my best create a similar page to a popular site. 

Much of my time was spent on foused on styling components using styled components. Strugglings included using JS inside components. 

Other libraries used in this project were the tabs library, styled media query library and react router dom.
